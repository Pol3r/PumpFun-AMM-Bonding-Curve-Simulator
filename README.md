# PumpFun-AMM-Bonding-Curve-Simulator
Created a market maker from scratch in Python to simulate a Pump.Fun bonding curve. You will notice that the reserves, price impact, and market cap updates in real time.


-The default of a solana-contract for Pump.Fun coins is set in the reserves.

-When selecting buy take into account that the number or decimal number you put down has to be in sol.

-When selecting sell the input has to be in token amount not sol. You're exchanging now tokens for sol not sol for tokens.

-Update Sol price to your liking, market cap starting point changes depending on the price of sol. If you're trying to simulate live transactions just update with current price of sol.
